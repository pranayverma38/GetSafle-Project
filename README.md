# üåê Node.js Application Deployment on AWS (CI/CD + Docker + Terraform)

## üìå Objective

This project sets up a **containerized Node.js REST API** deployed on **AWS** using a **secure, scalable, and automated infrastructure**. It includes:
- Docker containerization
- Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Load balancing, monitoring, and security best practices

---

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Application: Node.js REST API

- Built with Express.js
- Sample Endpoints: `/health`, `/users`
- Environment variables are used for configuration (`PORT`, `DB_URL`)
- Unit testing implemented with Jest and Supertest

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Docker: Containerization

- **Dockerfile** uses a minimal `node:alpine` base image
- App runs as a **non-root user**
- `docker-compose.yml` (optional) for local development with PostgreSQL
- Exposes port 3000, production-ready

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure: Terraform on AWS

- **Modules** provision:
  - VPC (public/private subnets)
  - EC2 Auto Scaling Group behind ALB
  - Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)
  - AWS ECR
  - IAM Roles with least privilege
- Modular structure with reusable components
- All variables customizable via `terraform.tfvars`

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions

The CI/CD pipeline (in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) includes:

- **Test**: Runs unit tests on every push
- **Build & Push**: Builds Docker image and pushes to ECR
- **Deploy**: Applies infrastructure with Terraform and deploys to EC2
- **Rollback handling**: Can be extended with Terraform state locking and GitHub Action status checks

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ High Availability & Load Balancing üîÅ

This system is designed for **zero-downtime deployments** and **auto-scaling**.

### ‚úÖ Key Features
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Routes incoming traffic based on health checks
- **Auto Scaling Group**:
  - Automatically scales EC2 instances based on CPU/memory
  - Launches instances in multiple Availability Zones for redundancy
- **Health Checks**:
  - Configured on `/health` endpoint
  - Instances failing health checks are removed from ALB routing

### üìå Terraform Highlights
```hcl
resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "app_asg" {
  desired_capacity = 2
  max_size         = 4
  min_size         = 1
  ...
}

resource "aws_lb_target_group" "app_tg" {
  health_check {
    path                = "/health"
    healthy_threshold   = 2
    unhealthy_threshold = 2
  }
}
